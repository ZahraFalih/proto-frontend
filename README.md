### **Branch Naming Convention**

To maintain a structured and organized workflow, we follow this branch naming convention:

```
{pageOrScope}-{branchType}-{version}
```

#### **1. Page or Scope**
Indicates the specific part of the app the branch affects.

- `welcome`
- `signUp`
- `logIn`
- `dataCollection`
- `dashboard`
- `onboarding`
- `global` (for changes affecting multiple areas)

#### **2. Branch Type**
Describes the purpose of the branch.

- **`feature`** â†’ New feature development  
- **`bugfix`** â†’ Fixing bugs  
- **`refactor`** â†’ Code improvements (e.g., optimizing logic, cleaning up code)  
- **`chore`** â†’ Non-functional updates (e.g., configs, dependencies, documentation)  
- **`uiux`** â†’ UI/UX improvements (e.g., styling, responsiveness, layout updates)  
- **`dbsetup`** â†’ Database setup and configuration  
- **`llm`** â†’ Enhancing the LLM for better AI-driven analytics  
- **`authentication`** â†’ Setup Authentication   

#### **3. Version**
Each branch should have a version number for tracking purposes, starting from `0.1` and incrementing with each iteration.

### **Branch Versioning Guidelines**
- Start with `0.1` for new branches.
- Increment by `0.1` for each update or revision.
- Keep versioning consistent to track progress effectively.

By following this convention, we ensure clarity, maintainability, and better collaboration within the team. ðŸš€
